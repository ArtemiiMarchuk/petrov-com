            The works on view are made
            in the technique of paper collage,
            using visual attributes of op art,
            science fiction, and psychedelic
            culture.
            <br>
            <br>
            The tropes that can be recognized
            in my works are built around
            existential and cosmogonic
            subjects. These include images
            of infants and adults in the fetal
            position, black holes
            and wormholes, reverse evolution,
            and the cosmic vacuum in which
            geometric abstractions hang.
            <br>
            <br>
            The set of images and details
            for the collage in this case
            is detached from popular culture.
            There are no specific personalities,
            events, or symbols of modern
            history. Materials for the work
            I find in old scholarly books
            and journals, whose tone
            of images remains neutral
            and even detached.
            <br>
            <br>
            The work ranges in size from
            the classic poster size to miniature,
            as if telescopically reduced
            formats of 3x5cm.
            <br>
            <br>
            These factors create a kind
            of impenetrability, an airtightness
            to my art. And it seems that
            the shades of psychedelic
            revelation and fear of the cosmos
            are a consequence
            not of the impossibility,
            but of the desire to speak
            of the transcendent.
